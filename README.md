- üîä **System Audio Capture**: Records audio from speakers/headphones using ScreenCaptureKit
- üó£Ô∏è **Real-time Transcription**: Live speech-to-text using Deepgram API
- üîí **Permission Management**: Automatic handling of macOS audio and screen recording permissions
- üìù **Live Transcript Display**: Real-time display of transcribed text with confidence scores

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0+ (for ScreenCaptureKit system audio capture)
- Xcode 15.0+
- Deepgram API Key

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AudioAssist-macOS.git
cd AudioAssist-macOS
```

### 2. Get Deepgram API Key
1. Sign up at [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com)

## Permissions

The app requires the following macOS permissions:

- **Microphone Access**: For recording microphone audio
- **Screen Recording**: For capturing system audio via ScreenCaptureKit

The app will automatically request these permissions and guide you through the setup process.

## Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Grant required permissions when prompted
3. Click **Start** to begin audio capture and transcription
4. Speak or play audio - you'll see real-time transcription
5. Click **Stop** to end the session

## Architecture

- **AudioEngine.swift**: Main audio processing coordinator
- **MicCapture.swift**: Microphone audio capture using AVAudioEngine
- **SystemAudioCaptureSC.swift**: System audio capture using ScreenCaptureKit
- **DeepgramClient.swift**: WebSocket client for Deepgram API integration
- **ContentView.swift**: SwiftUI interface with permission management

## Technical Details

- **Audio Format**: 48kHz mono Int16 PCM for optimal Deepgram compatibility
- **Real-time Processing**: Low-latency audio capture and streaming
- **Permission Handling**: Robust macOS permission management with user guidance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and user feedback

## Known Issues

- Video frame drop warnings from ScreenCaptureKit are normal and don't affect audio capture
- In meetings, simultaneous microphone and system audio capture may cause echo - use headphones to prevent this
